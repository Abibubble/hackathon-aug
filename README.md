[Here is a link to the final project](https://abibubble.github.io/icecapades)

Icecapades is a modern take on the classic endless runner games. With simple controls and enjoyable gameplay, it aims to provide countless hours of entertainment.

We chose this as our hackathon project to give an innovative new twist on a well known (and incredibly frustrating) style of gameplay. Repeatedly trying the same things in an attempt to achieve different results, perhaps something that is a little too relateable by many software developers!

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion
The criteria for the August 2021 [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) Hackathon is **Retro Gaming**.  
We intend to provide a user friendly, thoroughly enjoyable application that takes the user back to when games were great. Simple to play, extremely hard to put down. We are aiming for square eyes and cramping fingers as our users endeavour to get Tux safely back home.

---

### User Stories

#### Client Needs

* A retro game that provides clear and substantial value to the user
* Use an original or innovative idea, design or implementation
* Has a well structured and completed documentation (README & Wireframes)
* Is well-planned and executed (using GitHub projects)
* Focus is realistic, and has an overall sense of completeness.

#### First Time Visitor

* Intuitive controls
* Clear rules/goals of the game
* Simple and logical navigation
* Positive emotive response

#### Returning Visitor

* Varied gameplay with increasing difficulty

---

## Design

### Color Scheme

* The game is focused around an ice/snow theme. This allowed us to utilise a blue/white colour scheme, with some more vibrant colours to highlight relevant elements.

### Typography

* We have chosen the Snowtop Caps font for our heading from [1001fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/snowtop-caps-font.html) as it fits our ice/snow theme and is also free to use for commercial use.

### Imagery

We have chosen Tux, the Linux logo, as our playable character. He is related to code, fits into a theme very easily and promotes a positive emotive response.  
His enemies are a couple of 'juiced-up' worms and slugs, seeking revenge on a bird for all their relatives that have been eaten throughout the years.  
The boss is a snowman, called Brian Shady Grady. This is in-keeping with the icy theme and provides a tangible enemy with fun projectiles.

* To save time, we have utilised some free sprite libraries for animated characters and backgrounds. They were sourced from:
  * [gameartguppy](https://www.gameartguppy.com/)
  * [opengameart](https://opengameart.org/)
  * [gamedeveloperstudio](https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com/)
  * [gamedevmarket](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/)
* The sprite for the carrot projectile used by the snowman boss is from [opengameart](https://opengameart.org/content/easter-carrot-pick-up-item), the additional images to create the animation were generated using [Paint 3D](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

### Wireframes

[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](static/docs/icecapades.pdf).

### Features

* 

### Audio

* All audio is controlled by the audio on / off button, so that the user can choose if they'd like to hear audio.
* A cute 8-bit tune can be heard throughout the game when the user turns on the audio.
* There are also sound effects when the user has the audio on, for the following actions:
  * Tux jump
  * Tux kills a slug
  * An enemy is hit by a snowball
  * Tux catches a fish
  * Tux is hit
  * Tux slides
  * Tux collects a snowflake
  * Tux throws a snowball

### Testing User Stories

#### Client Goals

> A retro game that provides clear and substantial value to the user

* It is a retro-style side-scrolling game.
* It's a fun game with easy replayability.

> Use an original or innovative idea, design or implementation

* We have implemented this game using the HTML canvas element, with JavaScript to draw the game.
* The character we have used is Tux, the Linux mascot. This links the game back to coding, and also allowed the theme to be an icy, winter-y theme.

> Has a well structured and completed documentation (README & Wireframes)

* The README file clearly documents all important aspects of our project, along with testing and design ideas.
* The wireframes also show our planning and the clear vision we had for the finished game.

> Is well-planned and executed (using GitHub projects)

* [The Project board](https://github.com/Abibubble/icecapades/projects/1) is easily visible.
* It shows our progress throughout the project.

> Focus is realistic, and has an overall sense of completeness.

* We had to scale back a few of our ideas, in order to be realistic for the deadline.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

> Intuitive controls

* The game uses a mix of the two main standard gaming controls:
  * W to Jump, S to Slide, and D to Shoot
  * Up arrow key to Jump, Down arrow key to Slide, Space bar to Shoot

> Clear rules/goals of the game

* The controls and rules are clearly defined in the Instructions modal.

> Simple and logical navigation

* The site only has two pages.
* The main page has easily understandard icons on all buttons
* All buttons are clear to understand what they do.

> Positive emotive response

* We have used the nostalgia that a lot of people have for Tux.
* For many youngsters, Tux taught them to type, and thus, holds a special place in their hearts.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

> Varied gameplay with increasing difficulty

* The enemies are all randomised, so it varies constantly.

#### Desktop / Laptop

1. Google Chrome
    * All tested and working correctly.

2. Microsoft Edge
    * All tested and working correctly.

3. Mozilla Firefox
    * All tested and working correctly.

4. Safari
    * All tested and working correctly.

#### Tablet

1. Safari
    * All tested and working correctly.

#### Mobile Devices

1. Google Chrome
    * All tested and working correctly.

2. Safari
    * All tested and working correctly.

3. Samsung Internet
    * All tested and working correctly.

### Further Testing

The website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Samsung Internet browsers. It was not tested on Internet Explorer, as it has been depreciated and is not recommended for use. The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including:

* Custom built desktop PC, running Windows 10
* Acer Aspire V Nitro Laptop, running Windows 10
* Lenovo B51 IntelCore i7 Laptop, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2017), running macOS Catalina
* MacBookAir7,2 (13-inch, 2017)
* iPad 6,11 5th generation, running iOS 10.3
* Amazon Fire tablet 7
* iPhone 7
* iPhone X
* iPhone 12
* OPPO Find X2
* OPPO Find X2 Lite
* Samsung Galaxy A70
* Samsung Galaxy S9
* Samsung Galaxy S10+
* Samsung A20
* xBox One

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all items were visible or hidden correctly, all characters and items were animated correctly, all buttons worked as they should, and the game worked as it should.

### Solved Bugs

1. Having one modal open didn't stop another modal opening too.
    * We realised that the open modal function wasnt being called.
    * We added a check for a modal class in with other functions and this fixed the bug.

2. Stitching error, a background has a single line gap from top to bottom.
  *  the code below was used to close the stitching error in the background.
  
  ```
  if (this.x <= - this.width){
    this.x = this.width + this.x2 - this.speed;
  }
  if (this.x2 <= - this.width){
      this.x2 = this.width + this.x - this.speed;
  }
  ```

### Known Bugs

* There is occasionally an enemy that doesn't die when hit.

### Lighthouse

I tested my website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop

![Lighthouse desktop first try](static/docs/lighthouse.png)

#### Performance:
* This has a good result, as we chose to not use any frameworks or libraries.

#### Accessibility:
* All images have alt text.
* All tap targets are correctly sized, and aren't overlapping other content.
* All colors are WCAG AA compliant.

#### Best Practices:
* This was knocked down due to issues in the console.
* The console error is due to the webmanifest, which we couldn't find a fix for.

#### SEO:
* All relevant meta tags have been included for full social media integration.
* All search engine relevant meta tags have been included with full content.
