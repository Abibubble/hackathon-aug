[Here is a link to the final project](https://abibubble.github.io/icecapades)

<!-- BASIC DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
It is designed to be responsive on a wide range of devices, whilst also being easy to navigate through. -->
Icecapades is a modern take on the classic endless runner games. With simple controls and enjoyable gameplay, it aims to provide countless hours of entertainment.

<!-- WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS PROJECT -->
We chose this as our hackathon project to give an innovative new twist on a well known (and incredibly frustrating) style of gameplay. Repeatedly trying the same things in an attempt to achieve different results, perhaps something that is a little too relateable by many software developers!

## User Experience (UX)

### Initial Discussion
<!-- WHAT I WANTED FROM THIS PROJECT -->
The criteria for the August - [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net) - hackathon is **Retro Gaming**.  
We intend to provide a user friendly, thoroughly enjoyable application that takes the user back to when games were great. Simple to play, extremely hard to put down. We are aiming for square eyes and cramping fingers as our users endeavour to go one step further than their peers.

---

### User Stories

#### Client Needs

<!-- * WHAT THE CLIENT WANTS, NOT THE USER -->
* A retro game that provides clear and substantial value to the user
* Use an original or innovative idea, design or implementation
* Has a well structured and completed documentation (README & Wireframes)
* Is well-planned and executed (using GitHub projects)
* Focus is realistic, and has an overall sense of completeness.

#### First Time Visitor
<!-- * WHAT A FIRST TIME VISITOR WANTS, LIKE EASY TO UNDERSTAND, EASY TO NAVIGATE -->
* Intuitive controls
* Clear rules/goals of the game
* Simple and logical navigation
* Positive emotive response

#### Returning Visitor
<!-- * LIKE REPLAYABILITY, WHY THEY WANT TO RETURN TO THE SITE, EXTRA FEATURES -->
* High score feature
* Varied gameplay with increasing difficulty

#### Frequent Visitor
<!-- * WHY SOMEONE WOULD COME BACK REPEATEDLY, AND WHAT THEY'D WANT, LIKE EASY TO BOOK SOMETHING, OR A SCOREBOARD, ETC. -->
* Score board to compare other user's scores

---

## Design

### Color Scheme
<!-- * WHAT COLORS USED AND WHY -->
* The game is focused around an ice/snow theme. This allowed us to utilise a blue/white colour scheme, with some more vibrant colours to highlight relevant elements.

### Typography

* WHAT FONT AND WHY

### Imagery
<!-- * WHAT IMAGES ARE USED AND WHY -->
We have chosen Tux, the Linux logo, as our playable character. He is related to code, fits into a theme very easily and promotes a positive emotive response.  
His enemies are a couple of 'juiced-up' worms and slugs, seeking revenge on a bird for all their relatives that have been eaten throughout the years.  
The boss is a snowman. This is in-keeping with the icy theme and provides a tangible enemy with fun projectiles.

* To save time, we have utilised some free sprite libraries for animated characters and backgrounds. They were sourced from:
  * [gameartguppy](https://www.gameartguppy.com/)
  * [opengameart](https://opengameart.org/)
  * [gamedeveloperstudio](https://www.gamedeveloperstudio.com/)
  * [gamedevmarket](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/)
* The sprite for the carrot projectile used by the snowman boss is from [opengameart](https://opengameart.org/content/easter-carrot-pick-up-item), the additional images to create the animation were generated using [Paint 3D](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

### Wireframes

[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf).

### Features
<!-- * WHAT FEATURES ARE ONE THE SITE, LIKE SCOREBOARD, FUNCTIONS, SCROLLING ALERT BAR, ETC. -->

### Audio

* WHAT AUDIO IS USED (IF ANY) AND WHY.
